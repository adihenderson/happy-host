                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to The Happy Host! We are lifelong best friends who live in two different tourist
                    hotspots in the Western United States. One of us lives within a mile of gorgeous beaches on the
                    golden
                    coast of California with towering eucalyptus trees in the backyard. The other in the deeply forested
                    northwest 15 minutes from a ski resort and 5 minutes to a huge lakeside beach. And though we are
                    seperated by considerable distance we have been talking nearly every week for the last 23 years and
                    travel together every year. Our family and friends love to visit us and over the years we have
                    learned a
                    lot about what makes for a pleasant trip, for both the host and the house guest. Whether you are
                    looking
                    for ways to make your life easier as a host, or for tips on how to be a gracious houseguest, youâ€™ve
                    come
                    to the right spot. Feel free to browse through our site, or subscribe to receive email updates when
                    new
                    content is posted. Happy hosting! -E & A
